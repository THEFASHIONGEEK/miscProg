Othello Bot:
============

> The program is a bot for the playing the classic Reversi (aka Othello).
>
> Uses the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to search for good moves to play.
>
> Instead of directly considering the end score, the bot also considers the scores of the intermediate states.
>
> The major factor affecting the performance of the bot is the evaluation function used.
>
> Currently the evaluation function uses heuristics such as risk regions, stable nodes, etc.
